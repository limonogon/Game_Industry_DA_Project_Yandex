    "But it took as long as 15-20 years of technology development to start mass production of games. The main peak in the release of games falls on 2008-2010.\n",

    "\n",
    "On average, the platform relevance cycle is 8-10 years.\n",
    "Then the relevance of the platform disappears, or the next generation of the platform comes out.\n",
    "There is one special console that remained relevant for an abnormally long period - for 28 years Nintendo did not let go of the players, mostly Japanese.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build forecasts for 2017, we took data for the period of the industry downturn in 2009-2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noticeable that with the evolution of a specific platform, sales by games, as well as the cost of producing games, grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the games were released in the Action, Miscellaneous and Sports genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "In different markets, user preferences regarding gaming platforms and genres may differ. For example, as already mentioned, the Japanese prefer Nintendo and RPGs the most.\n",
    "In general, the Japanese market is very different from other markets, mainly due to all the early development since the 80s and the completely unique mentality of the Japanese."
