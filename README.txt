# Game_Industry_DA_Project_Yandex

Description of the project You work in the online store "Stremchik", which sells computer games all over the world.
Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources.

You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game.
This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan your advertising campaigns.

You have data up to 2016. Let's say it's December 2016 and you're planning a campaign for 2017.
We need to work out the principle of working with data.
It doesn't matter if you predict 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 based on 2026 data.
